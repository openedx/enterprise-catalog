# Version constraints for pip installation.
#
# This file doesn't install any packages. It specifies version constraints
# that will be applied if a package is needed.
#
# When pinning something here, please provide an explanation of why.  Ideally,
# link to other information that will help people in the future to remove the
# pin when possible.  Writing an issue against the offending project and
# linking to it here is good.

# using LTS django version
Django>=5.2,<5.3

# At least version 3.4.0 of django simple history
django-simple-history>=3.4.0

# As it is not clarified what exact breaking changes will be introduced as per
# the next major release, ensure the installed version is within boundaries.
celery>=5.2.2,<6.0.0

# diff-cover latest requires (pluggy>=0.13.1,<0.14.0)
# which conflicts with pytest(pluggy>=0.12,<2.0.0) and tox(pluggy>0.12) both of these fetch pluggy==1.0.0
# but diff-cover latest has a pin (pluggy<1.0.0a1)
# Using the same version of diff-cover which is being used currently in edx-platform to avoid this conflict.
diff-cover==4.0.0

# To avoid any breaking changes
openai<=1.13.3

# algoliasearch 4.0 is not backwards compatible with 3.0
algoliasearch<4

# pip 25.3 is incompatible with pip-tools hence causing failures during the build process 
# Make upgrade command and all requirements upgrade jobs are broken due to this.
# See issue https://github.com/openedx/public-engineering/issues/440 for details regarding the ongoing fix.
# The constraint can be removed once a release (pip-tools > 7.5.1) is available with support for pip 25.3
# Issue to track this dependency and unpin later on: https://github.com/openedx/edx-lint/issues/503
